# Bank-customer-evaluation
I have classfied Bank customers based on several features who will subscribe for term deposits using Logistic Regression.
It is useful for Banks to evalute customers weather they will enroll for term deposits or not.
I created model on 70% of the cleaned data and did validation on 30% of the cleaned data and finally apply that model on test data and evaluated the model with AUC score.
